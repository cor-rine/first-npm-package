# first-npm-package
_____

Let's just pretend for one second that this is actually 100% a useful pacakge and so I will choose to write this documentation as though it will actually be worth while.  But really, it's not at all that impressive, nor is this code truly mine.  But I did learn a lot, and I will be building my own node package shortly.... I digress.

## Installation

    npm install replacethis


## Usage

    replacethis [file] [searchWord] [replaceWith]
    
Example:

    replacethis test.txt dog cat
    

The contents will be output into a new file _out.txt_.
